**How did people with different social identities perceive EDI-related issues?**

We also asked respondents to answer on a 7-point Likert scale how much they agree with the following three statements on their perception of EDI issues: 1) "I think the Congress attendees represented the diversity of researchers in our field" ("diversity" in short); 2) "Our research field experiences equity, diversity and inclusion related issues (eg. racism, homophobia, harassment, bullying etc.)" ("EDI issues" in short); 3) "I think the questions asked after the talks were equally divided across genders" ("no QA gender disparity" in short).

Similar to the analyses for congress experience, we fitted ordinal GLMs, one per statement, to identify which social identity variables explain variation in the Likert-scale response to the statement. Instead of fitting expertise rating as an independent variable, we fitted career stage (early, mid or late), as more senior researchers are more likely to have experienced different research environments and consequently, potential for EDI issues, which is not always linked to age. We again controlled for the level of comfort a person had speaking English.

The results indicate that gender and LGBTQ+ identity affected whether a person agreed more with the diversity of researchers in our field was represented at the congress. Men had higher agreement compared to women, and LGBTQ+ people had lower agreement compared to non-LGBTQ+ people.

The results indicate that even though gender and nationality were significant in the univariate models, when accounting for LGBTQ+ identity and expat status, they are not significant anymore in the final model (although nationality is borderline significant). The final model shows that LGBTQ+ identities agree more with there being EDI issues in our field, and so do expats. Looking at nationality, the result is difficult to interpret due to the unbalanced sample size and needing to drop the nationality on a sub-continent level to zoom out to the continent level. Nevertheless, it appears that North American nationalities agrees more compared to European nationalities.

The results indicate that even though gender, LGBTQ+ and nationality were significant in the univariate models, when accounting for all other significant variables too, they are not significant anymore in the final model (although LGBTQ+ and nationality are borderline significant). The final model shows that Asian countries agree more compared to European nationalities. South American affiliates agree less compared to European affiliations. Lastly, people who are more comfortable speaking English agree less with the statement.

LGBTQ+ identities agree more with there being EDI issues in our field, and so do expats. Looking at nationality, the result is difficult to interpret due to the unbalanced sample size and needing to drop the nationality on a sub-continent level to zoom out to the continent level. Nevertheless, it appears that North American nationalities agrees more compared to European nationalities.
