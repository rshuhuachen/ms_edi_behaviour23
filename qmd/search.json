Information on participants, collected during abstract submission and registration 2. Question asking behaviour during the congress 3. Post-congress survey\nThe manuscript will be structured differently, however the structure of this repository is based on the teams working on the different parts rather than the manuscript structure."

    "section": "",
    "text": "6 Introduction\nWe circulated a survey after the end of the congress, addressed to all congress attendees as well as people who knew about the congress but did not end up registering. This post-congress survey consisted of a number of different partswhere some results are just presented in words, whereas others require modelling. Please navigate using the menu to jump to various sections of the analysis.\nFirst, personal information on EDI metrics were collected, including gender, pronouns, career stage, nationality, affiliation, LGBTQIA+, age category and disability. Depending on the research question, each factor was used as a predictor and/or controlling variable.\nThis is what the distribution of answers for each metric looks like Figure 7.1. In addition to nationality and affiliation, we included a metric called “Expat status” which indicates whether a person’s country of affiliation is the same country as the country of their nationality.\nAll participants of the congress had to agree to the Code of Conduct. In the survey, we asked whether they read our inclusivity and accessibility page (this page included information about childcare, special needs, safe-space measures and the Code of Conduct, see the website) before making their decision to attend the Congress. The responses were as follows:\nYes, I read it: N = 168, % = 42.97\nNo: N = 100, % = 25.58\nI saw it but did not read it : N = 118, % = 30.18\nOut of those that read it, 43 people said that the inclusivity and accessibility page played a role in their decision to attend the congress (25.6%).\nWe decided to leave out this part as not all symposium conveners attended the congress, and multiple conveners could have filled out details on the same symposium.\nA total of 5 people filled in the survey but did not attend the congress. 1 out of 5 submissions did not attend due to time restriction and 2 did not attend due to funding limitations. Other reasons were:\nParticipants were asked to answer on a scale of 1-7 how much they agree with the following three statements: 1) “I am an expert in my field”; 2) “I fully understand the work presented in the talks that I attended”; 3) “I fell comfortable speaking in English”. Below you can find the distribution of answers (Figure 11.1).\nThe congress experience questions can be divided into two sub-categories: a) questions about discrimination/harassment and reporting of this; b) sense of belonging.\nIn the post-congress survey, we asked three main questions with regards to question asking during the congress (and in general): 1) did you ask a question during the congress; 2) what are you main motivations to ask a question during this congress and in general and 3) what are you main hesitations to ask a question during this congress and in general. Question 2 and 3 are multiple-choice answers, where people can check if one or more motivators/hesitations are applicable to them.\nWe want to answer the question why women ask less questions than men do. To do so, we take a two-step approach: first we ask which motivations and hesitations are affected by gender, and second, we take those motivations and hesitations that are significantly affected by gender and ask if they are significantly associated with the probability for a person to ask a question.\nNext, we aimed to answer which social identities evaluate EDI issues at STEM differently. More specifically, we asked survey participants three questions that were answered on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree):\nSimilar to the analysis of congress experience, we first modeled each of the six variables (nationality, gender, English level comfort, career stage, LGBTQI+, expat status and affiliation) in separate models as a single fixed effect, for each of the three questions (3x6 = 18 models). In this case, we do not model age nor career stage as these are correlated to career stage, and career stage (and therefore experience measured in years and number of positions) is more relevant to this particular question. In addition to including LGBTQI+ and gender in the model, we also compared a model that included the interaction between LGBTQI+ and gender in another model and compared this to those that did not include the interaction in an LRT.\nThe final model then only concluded the variables that explain a significant amount of variation (i.e. the LRT between the null and alternative model had a p-value &lt; 0.05) in the three responses. We used the MASS::polr function again to fit the ordinal response variable (Likert scale data).\nA total of 11 people used the free childcare service offered, of which 7 researchers would not have been able to attend the congress without. A total of 7 indicated that they would be able to attend more conferences if (free) childcare was available as a standard.\nA total of 18 people indicated that they have some form of a disability, but 11 researchers did not inform us about this disability. Out of those that did, 0 indicated we were able to accommodate to their disability but it could have been better. The qualitative feedback includes some good examples, suggestions and tips for event organizers to make scientific conferences more accessible and inclusive for disabled researchers."

Here, I only present the final model for each of the three response variables. The variables of interest are: age, nationality, gender, english level comfort, career stage (to compare with age), expertise level, expat status and affiliation.\nThe models I used for these Likert scale responses are implemented using the polr function within the MASS package. I could not think of random effects t include in the model. The significance of a variable was assessed with a likelihood ratio test comparing the null model (only the intercept) with the alternative model.\n\n12.2.1 Feeling heard\nThe variables that were not significantly associated with feeling heard were: nationality (sub-continent), affiliation (sub-continent), expat status and gender. The variables age, career stage and expertise rating were all significantly associated with sense of belonging, however they are all highly correlated with each other.

Women are more comfortable to ask a question when: the speaker, audience and gender is of their own gender, and in smaller audiences."

    "text": "13.2 Which reasons are important in predicting the probability of asking a question?\nNext, we ask which reasons (motivations, hesitations and conditions) explain variation in the probability to ask a question at Behaviour 2023. To do so, we build the following models: glm(ask_question ~ reason + gender + career_stage, family = \"binomial\") where ask_question is a binary variable where 1 indicates that the person asked one or more questions during the Q&A sessions.

There is a counter-intuitive result for ‘not being chosen’ and ‘no time’, where ticking one of these options is associated with a higher likelihood of asking a question, and this is because we did not make a distinction between intended question asking (i.e. raising your hand) versus realized question asking (you were chosen to ask a question). The only condition that is affected by gender and explains variation in question asking probability is the gender of the speaker.\nFrom these results we conclude that women are less likely to ask a question because they do not feel clever enough, they are intimidated by the audience, and/or due to a lack of confidence. Although women are more hesitant to ask their question because they are scared to formulate/articulate their question, this does not appear to explain the difference in men and women in actual asking of questions. Moreover, women feel more comfortable asking questions when the speaker is of their own gender."

    "text": "5 Introduction\nAt the congress, we collected data on question asking behaviour during Q&A sessions. Although ideally we would have assessed bias in question asking behaviour across multiple social identities, due to logistic and practical reasons, we focus on gender only, as this is the most conspicuous identity that can be observed in a real-life setting. We randomly sampled X% of all sessions at the congress, and ensured that at least 30% of the sessions were sampled by multiple observers so we could test for inter-observer reliability.\nA total of 25 observers collected data on question-asking behaviour across the five days of talks. Talks were given in lecture halls of three different sizes: small (&lt; X people), medium (X people) and large (X people). Because it is difficult to observe all people in large lecture rooms, these sessions were always sampled by two observers, and a double-sampled session would therefore mean the session was observed by four people. Each day was divided into two time sessions: the morning and the afternoon, each split in two by a coffee break. In general, any type of uncertainty in the data was noted down by the observers and accounted for during the analysis.\nObservers were seated in the back corner of the lecture hall to get a better overview of the audience and to remain subtle when counting people. There are a few different meta-data variables that were used for the analysis: session ID, day number (1-5), lecture hall (1-9), symposium vs. general session, Different types of data were collected at different levels: session information, talk information, and question information.\nMoreover, to ensure our study has practical implications, we wanted to investigate if the behaviour of the session host can help overcome gender-equality barriers. Previous studies have found that men are more likely to ask questions at scientific events (Hinsley et al., 2017), which is the consequence of a combination of many complex factors. These factors include both inherent differences between genders as well as the differences in research landscapes that people face. Scientific contribution such as question-asking is a product of scientific reputation, social reputation, discrimination and stereotyping, self-promotion and the positive feedback within this framework (Hinsley et al., 2017). If women are more encouraged to ask a question when a woman asks the first question, session hosts could play a role in battling inequality during scientific participation.\nTherefore, for a subset of sessions (around 30%), we manipulated the session host behaviour. More specifically, we instructed session hosts to either give the first question after a talk to a woman or to a man. We semi-randomly assigned session hosts to either an unmanipulated or manipulated session. If the session host was part of the Organization Committee, they were automatically assigned to a manipulated session. Session hosts of unmanipulated sessions were unaware of our study and were not contacted prior or after the congress about the study. The session hosts of manipulated sessions were asked by email, 2 weeks prior to the congress, if they wanted to participate in our study, without mentioning the exact goal or what the task included. If the session host agreed (X/X cases), they were given instructions specific to their session. For each talk within their session, they were instructed to give the first question after a talk to a woman (condition ) or to a man (condition 2). The two conditions were randomly assigned across manipulated sessions while ensuring an equal ratio of conditions. ** note to self: left it here **\nIn the Methods section of the manuscript, we outline a few details: manual corrections and curation fo the data, how we combined data from multiple observers, if inferred gender matches with ones preferred pronouns, and if inferred age matches with one’s self-reported age.\nWe will explain the exact methods and results for each research question in detail below. However, here we will describe the general model set-up that we use to make it easier to follow later on. For most questions, the null hypothesis is that there is no gender-bias in question asking, meaning that the number of questions asked by women is proportional to the number of women in the audience. This means that if 70% of the audience is female, 70% of the questions should be asked by women if there were no gender bias. To formulate this into a statistical model, we used binomial mixed effect models that look as follows:\nglmer(gender_questioner ~ 1 + (session_id/talk_id), family = \"binomial\", offset=boot::logit(audience_women_prop))\nWhere gender_questioner is a binary variable indicating whether a woman (1) asked a question or a man (0). The random effect structure accounts for the independence between talks of the same session. The offset argument is used to correct for the gender proportion in the audience, which was calculated based on the number of men in the audience and total audience size. If the intercept in the model is positive, this means that women are more likely to ask a question than men do when taking into account the audience gender proportion.\nFor all models, we exclude any questions that were asked by the host, were a follow-up (by the same person without another person asking a question in between), or when the question asker did not raise their hand. As a supplementary analysis, we repeated every model excluding data that any level of uncertainty, to ensure this uncertainty did not bias our results. Unless specified otherwise, we only look at the sessions that were untreated (i.e. session host was not contacted or instructed about anything).\n-Jonas-\nFirst, we want to answer whether in general, women ask less questions than men do at the congress.\n# model setup\nmodel_qa_general &lt;- glmer(gender_questioner_female ~ 1 + (1|session_id/talk_id), family = \"binomial\", offset=boot::logit(audience_women_prop), data = data_control)\n\n# summary of the model\nsummary(model_qa_general)\n\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula: gender_questioner_female ~ 1 + (1 | session_id/talk_id)\n   Data: data_control\n Offset: boot::logit(audience_women_prop)\n\n     AIC      BIC   logLik deviance df.resid \n   516.5    528.2   -255.2    510.5      369 \n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.5993 -0.9276 -0.7069  1.0326  1.4603 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups             Name        Variance  Std.Dev. \n talk_id:session_id (Intercept) 0.000e+00 0.000e+00\n session_id         (Intercept) 9.873e-16 3.142e-08\nNumber of obs: 372, groups:  talk_id:session_id, 131; session_id, 24\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

For each person asking a question, the following were noted: the gender of the person asking the question, age class of the questioner, if there are words of positive appraisal given to the speaker, the type of question. Notes were taken if one of the following situations occurred: a person asked a question without raising their hand (jumper), the session host asked the question, the presenter chose who asked the question instead of the session host, an observer asked a question, a person asks multiple questions in one go, a person asks multiple questions in one Q&A but not consecutively,"

If this was not mentioned, we gap-filled these details after the congress based on publicly available data.\nAge was divided into three categories: under 35, between 35-50, and above 50 years old. Age was inferred from a person’s appearance (facial features, hair colour, voice, clothing). We instructed observers to be careful to bias their age estimation by a person’s career stage, as these are not always directly linked to each other."
