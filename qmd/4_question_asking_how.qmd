**How does the gender disparity arise?**

Because we recorded not only the gender of the participants who asked questions, but also the gender of the people who raised their hands to ask their question, we could identify how the gender disparity in question asking arose.

## Do women raise their hands less often?

First, we asked whether women raise their hands less than men do, by fitting a binomial GLMM where the dependent variables were the number of women and men that raised their hands, while accounting for the gender proportion of the audience and the nonindependence of talks within a session, similar to above (see Methods for details).

```{r raise hands, echo =T, warning=F, message=F}

# subset data

data_control <- subset(data_analysis, treatment == "Control" &
                     is.na(followup) & is.na(jumper)&
                     is.na(host_asks) & 
                    !grepl("speaker|questioner", allocator_question))

data_control <- droplevels(data_control)

# second dataset to test robustness to data with uncertainty

data_conserved <- subset(data_control, uncertainty_count_audience == 0 & uncertainty_count_hands == 0)

# exclude situations where the hand count was incorrect and there were on paper more hands raised by men only then in total

data_hands <- subset(data_control, hands_prop_men <= 1)

m_qa_hands <- glmer(cbind(hands_women, hands_men) ~ 1 + (1|session_id/talk_id), family = "binomial", 
                  offset=boot::logit(audience_women_prop), 
                  data = data_hands)


# model output
summary(m_qa_hands)

# use helper function to collect model output in data frame
m_qa_hands_out <- collect_out(model = m_qa_hands, null = NA, 
                              name = "QA_hands", n_factors = 0, type = "qa", save="yes", dir="../results/question-asking/")

m_qa_hands_out %>% t() %>% kbl() %>%
  kable_classic_2()
```

## Do women get chosen less to ask their question? {#sec-hands}

### Observational data

Next, we asked whether women get chosen less to ask their question, by fitting another binomial GLMM using the gender of the questioner as the dependent variable, but this time correcting for the gender proportion of the people that raised their hands instead.

```{r chosen, echo = T, warning=F, message=F}

# exclude situations where the host did not make a choice between genders (i.e. only men or only women raised hands)

m_qa_chosen <- glmer(gender_questioner_female ~ 1 + (1|talk_id), family = "binomial", offset=boot::logit(hands_prop_women), data = subset(data_hands, hands_prop_women !=0 & hands_prop_women != 1))

# can't get the CI's when including (1|session_id/talk_id)! 

# model output
summary(m_qa_chosen)

# use helper function to collect model output in data frame
m_qa_chosen_out <- collect_out(model = m_qa_chosen, null = NA, name = "QA_chosen", n_factors = 0, type = "qa", save="yes", dir="../results/question-asking/")

m_qa_chosen_out %>% t() %>% kbl() %>%
  kable_classic_2()


```

Thus, we show that women ask less questions at the congress because women raised their hands less often than men do (GLMM intercept = `r m_qa_hands_out$intercept_estimate`, p-value = `r m_qa_hands_out$intercept_pval`), not because they were chosen less often by session hosts to ask their question compared to men (GLMM intercept = `r m_qa_chosen_out$intercept_estimate`, p-value = `r m_qa_chosen_out$intercept_pval`).

### Survey data

We can answer whether there is a gender disparity in the probability that a person did *not* ask a question because they were *not* chosen to do so using the post-congress survey data, too. More specifically, we asked the question in the survey if a person did not ask a question because they were not chosen to do so. We model if the response to this (applies = 1, doesn't apply = 0) is affected by gender.

```{r survey not ask, echo=T, warning=F, message=F}

# reorder factors
survey$gender <- factor(survey$gender, levels = c("Male", "Female", "Non-binary"))

# explore data
table(survey$reason_noquestion_notchosen, survey$gender) %>% kbl() %>% kable_classic_2()
  
# model and null model
m_survey_chosen <- glm(reason_noquestion_notchosen ~ gender, data = subset(survey, !is.na(gender)), family = "binomial")

summary(m_survey_chosen)

m_survey_chosen_null <- glm(reason_noquestion_notchosen ~ 1, data = subset(survey, !is.na(gender)), family = "binomial")

# helper function to get model output

m_survey_chosen_out <- collect_out(model = m_survey_chosen, null = m_survey_chosen_null, name="survey_qa_chosen", n_factors = 2, type="survey", save="yes", dir="../results/question-asking/")

m_survey_chosen_out %>% t() %>% kbl() %>%
  kable_classic_2()

```

In line with the observational data, gender did not contribute to the probability that a person did not ask a question because they were not chosen to do so based on the survey data (LRT p-value = `r m_survey_chosen_out$lrt_pval`)

The gender disparity in question asking therefore likely arises due to internal factors that cause women to raise their hands less often to ask a question compared to men.

## Plot data

```{r load in general, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}

m_qa_general <- glmer(gender_questioner_female ~ 1 + (1|session_id/talk_id), family = "binomial", offset=boot::logit(audience_women_prop), data = data_control)

# use helper function to collect model output in data frame
m_qa_general_out <- collect_out(model = m_qa_general, null = NA, 
                              name = "QA_justIC", n_factors = 0, type = "qa", save="no")

```

Next, we can plot the results to visualize the reason why women ask less questions than men do.

```{r plot, echo = T, message=F, warning=F, fig.width=8, fig.height=10}

# combine output from all sessions and plenaries 
m_why_general <- rbind(m_qa_chosen_out, m_qa_hands_out, m_qa_general_out)
m_why_general$name <- c("Getting chosen to ask", "Raising hands", "Asking questions") 
m_why_general$name <- factor(m_why_general$name, levels=c("Getting chosen to ask", "Raising hands", "Asking questions"))

ggplot(m_why_general) +
  geom_point(aes(x = intercept_estimate, y = name), size = 5) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = intercept_ci_lower, xend = intercept_ci_higher, y = name),
               linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, col = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Intercept and 95% CI", y = "Model") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = "Male bias", y = 3.5, x = -0.5, size = 4))+
  geom_text(aes(label = "Female bias", y = 3.5, x = 0.5, size = 4)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.2, xend = -0.8, y = 3.3),
               col = "black", arrow = arrow(length=unit(0.2, "cm")))+
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.2, xend = 0.8, y = 3.3),
               col = "black", arrow = arrow(length=unit(0.2, "cm"))) +  theme(legend.position = "none") -> plot_1_qa_why

### also add survey

# convert to include both female and non-binary

m_survey_chosen_out$name <- c("Didn't ask because I wasn't chosen to") 

m_survey_chosen_out_long <- data.frame(factor = c("Female", "Non-binary"),
                                estimate = c(m_survey_chosen_out$est_genderFemale, m_survey_chosen_out$`est_genderNon-binary`),
                                lower = c(m_survey_chosen_out$lowerCI_genderFemale, m_survey_chosen_out$`lowerCI_genderNon-binary`),
                                upper = c(m_survey_chosen_out$higherCI_genderFemale, m_survey_chosen_out$`higherCI_genderNon-binary`))

ggplot(m_survey_chosen_out_long) +
  geom_point(aes(x = estimate, y = factor), size = 5) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = lower, xend = upper, y = factor),
               linewidth=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, col = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Gender effect estimate and 95% CI", y = "Model") + 
  xlim(-2, 3.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = "Male bias", y = 2.5, x = -1, size = 4))+
  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.3, xend = -1.8, y = 2.4),
               col = "black", arrow = arrow(length=unit(0.2, "cm")))+
  theme(legend.position = "none") -> plot_2_survey_chosen

cowplot::plot_grid(plot_1_qa_why, plot_2_survey_chosen, ncol = 1,
                   align = "hv", axis = "lb", labels = c("a) Behavioural data", "b) Survey data"))

```

## Supplementary: rerun models with conservative data

As mentioned, we repeated the analysis on the observational data with the 'conservative' data set, which excluded any questions that some level of uncertainty in the collection.

```{r conserved, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}

# hands raised
summary(glmer(cbind(hands_women, hands_men) ~ 1 + (1|session_id/talk_id), family = "binomial", offset=boot::logit(audience_women_prop), data = subset(data_conserved, hands_prop_men <= 1)))

# getting chosen
summary(glmer(gender_questioner_female ~ 1 + (1|session_id/talk_id), family = "binomial", offset=boot::logit(hands_prop_women), data = subset(data_conserved, hands_prop_women !=0 & hands_prop_women != 1 & hands_prop_men <= 1)))

```

The model results seem virtually identical!
